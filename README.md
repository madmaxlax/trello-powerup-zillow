# Glitch Hosted Zillow API Trello Power-Up ðŸš€

Example Trello board that uses this power-up https://trello.com/b/u3DaGqVL/zillow-api

This power-up makes use of the Zillow API for house values/rentals. 



**NOTE**: unfortunately, zillow isn't able to "redistribute" a lot (most) of their data, [explanation here](https://www.zillow.com/advice-thread/501-on-GetUpdatedPropertyDetails/374287/), so all values are **[ZESTIMATES](https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/)** and not the actual listed values
so this API and power up isn't as cool as I was hoping it would be. also annoying that Zillow has its API in XML and not JSON format, but that is easily solved by the [xml2js npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js)

Getting started:

 - get a Zillow API ID [here](https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm)
 - put it in the .env file here in Glitch
 
```
SECRET=
MADE_WITH=
zwsid=xxxAPIxxKEYxxx
```
